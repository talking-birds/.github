# Talking Birds

We are a Coventry-based company of artists known for our gently provocative projects which explore, and seek to illuminate, the profound and complex relationships between people and place. We're big on access, human connection, social and ecological responsibility, and on nurturing the next generation of artists and theatre makers, particularly in Coventry.
